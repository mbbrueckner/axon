## XOR (`examples/xor_demo.cpp`) results

**Setup:** A 2-4-1 MLP (`Linear(2,4) → ReLU → Linear(4,1)`) trained on all four
XOR samples (full-batch) for 1000 epochs with SGD (learning rate 0.1) against
the mean squared error.

```
./build/examples/xor
Epoch: 0;   loss: 0.522413;    acc.: 0.5
Epoch: 100; loss: 0.0178309;   acc.: 1
Epoch: 200; loss: 0.000173242; acc.: 1
...
Epoch: 900; loss: 3.23491e-13; acc.: 1
```

**Interpretation:**

- The model reaches **100 % accuracy by epoch 100** and drives the loss down by
  roughly **twelve orders of magnitude**, flattening near `~1e-13` — the
  effective precision floor of 32-bit floats.
- XOR is **not linearly separable**, so fitting it requires the hidden ReLU
  layer. Successfully learning it end-to-end validates that the full pipeline —
  tensor ops, autograd/backprop, and the SGD update — works correctly.

**Caveats:**

- Weights are initialized from `std::random_device` (see `Linear`), so the exact
  loss values vary between runs; the convergence behaviour does not.
- This is a **correctness check, not a generalization benchmark**: with only four
  samples and no train/test split, the network simply memorizes the truth table.
  Measuring real generalization is what the MNIST roadmap item is for.
